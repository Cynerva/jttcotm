Day 1. I have embarked on a journey to the center of the moon.
Day 3. Nothing but repetitive gray as far as the eye can see.
Day 25. Time drags on. There are strange paintings here.
Day 50. Today is my birthday, I think. Happy birthday, Jones.
Day 110. Food supply is low. I may need to seek out the local moon rabbits for nourishment.
Day 111. I have spotted a moon rabbit. Here goes nothing.
Day 112. IMPORTANT REMINDER. DO NOT ENGAGE RABBITS. DO. NOT. ENGAGE!
Day 127. I remain lost in the caves. The moon rabbits draw near.
Day something. I don't know. Please get me out of here.
I hate moon rabbits. I hate moon rabbits. I hate moon rabbits. I hate moon rabbits.
I wonder what today is. It's probably Christmas.

One little two little three little bunnies four little five little six little bunnies seven little eight little nine little bunnies all upon my sword.
Moon rabbit stew. Add 1 cup of moon rabbits to large bowl. Stir. Tenderize with meat cleaver. Beware of retaliation. Serve and enjoy!
