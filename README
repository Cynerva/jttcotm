Journey to the Center of the Moon is an entry by Twin Fox for pyweek 17.

Our focus was on exploration and atmosphere, so, the gameplay is rather limited.

====== Controls ======
WASD or arrow keys to move. Enter to select menu entries. That's all.

Sorry I didn't make time for custom keys!

====== Playing on Ubuntu ======
The game requires python2.7, pygame, pybox2d and Polygon, which you can get
from pip. If you don't have pip, I believe Ubuntu comes with setuptools by
default so you can just use easy_install.

sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install pygame box2d polygon2
./jttcotm

====== Playing on Windows ======
Just double click on jttcotm.exe! Then yell at me when it inevitably doesn't
work. Don't worry, I deserve it.

====== Playing on Mac ======
... Uh... good luck! I didn't have a Mac to test anything on.
