Journey to the Center of the Moon is an entry by Twin Fox for pyweek 17.

====== Installation (Ubuntu) ======
Apologies for the horribly abbreviated install instructions. The game requires
python2, pybox2d and Polygon, which you can get from pip. If you don't have pip,
I believe Ubuntu comes with setuptools by default so you can just use easy_install.

sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install box2d polygon2
./run
